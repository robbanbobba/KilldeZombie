2-player click-game I built with two friends with TypeScript, node.js and socket.io. Written in march 2023. My part of the project was mainly focused on setting up and managing unique game-rooms, communicating with database and making cool css stuff and flashy effects for the intro. You can play the game here (you need two players, but u can play with yourself in two tabs or phone vs computer or something):
